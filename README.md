# __u.Fall__

This is the code I wrote for my team's project, u.Fall at [JAMHacks](jamhacks.ca) 2017. This was my first hackathon, as well as my first experience working with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) code and an [Intel Edison Module](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison).

We used the provided [Xadow Intel Wearable Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Xadow-Wearable-Kit-For-Intel%26reg%3B-Edison-p-2428.html). The code detects changes in the accelerometer and triggers the LEDs and buzzer if an large change is detected. NFC is used to turn off the alarms and reset the accelerometer.
